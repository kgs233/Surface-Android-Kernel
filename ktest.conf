# PWD is a ktest.pl variable that will result in the process working
# directory that ktest.pl is executed in.

# THIS_DIR is automatically assigned the PWD of the path that generated
# the config file. It is best to use this variable when assigning other
# directory paths within this directory. This allows you to easily
# move the test cases to other locations or to other machines.
